# Student Jobs and Admission Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict student admission chances and job prospects using machine learning models. It encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to provide insights into factors influencing admissions and employment outcomes.

## Features

* **Admission Prediction**: Estimate the likelihood of a student's admission based on academic and extracurricular profiles.
* **Job Prediction**: Assess job placement probabilities considering various student attributes.
* **Data Visualization**: Utilize Power BI for interactive dashboards to explore data trends and model outcomes.
* **Modular Codebase**: Organized structure with separate directories for notebooks, scripts, and visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Power BI Desktop (for .pbix files)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/06kunal/Student_Jobs_And_Admission_Prediction.git
   cd Student_Jobs_And_Admission_Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Explore Power BI Dashboards**:

   Open `.pbix` files in the `PowerBI files/` directory using Power BI Desktop.

## Usage

* Navigate to the `Notebook files/` directory to access Jupyter notebooks for:

  * Data preprocessing
  * Exploratory data analysis
  * Model training and evaluation

* Use the scripts in the `pycharm/` directory for:

  * Automated data processing
  * Model deployment pipelines

* Visualize insights and model predictions through Power BI dashboards located in the `PowerBI files/` directory.
